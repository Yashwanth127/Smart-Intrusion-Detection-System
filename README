# Smart Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Python and Cisco Packet Tracer

## 📚 Project Overview
This project simulates a network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer and implements a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python and Wireshark. It aims to monitor, detect, and alert unusual activities such as port scanning and SYN flooding within the network.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (Network Simulation)
- Wireshark (Packet Capturing)
- Python 3 (Custom IDS Development)
- Scapy (Python packet analysis library)

## 🏗️ Network Design
- 1 Router
- 1 Switch
- 2-3 Client PCs
- 1 Server
- 1 Mobile Device (optional for testing)

**Files:**
- `network_design/network_topology.pkt` : Simulated network file
- `network_design/screenshots/` : Screenshots of network layout

## 💻 Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Captures packets using Scapy or imports .pcap files
- Analyzes packet behavior
- Detects suspicious activities like:
  - Port Scanning
  - SYN Flooding
  - Malicious IP detection
- Alerts the user about potential attacks

**Files:**
- `python_ids/ids_script.py` : IDS Python script
- `python_ids/sample_captures/` : Sample pcap files for testing
